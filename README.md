This project is part of the **Meta Front-End Developer Capstone** final project assessment and focuses solely on **reservation functionality**. The technologies I have used in this project are listed below

    useContext 	- state management
    Chakra-UI 	- main UI
    Antd		- datepicker

If anyone is struggling to comprehend the instructions in the lesson like me, you can use this project as an example.
